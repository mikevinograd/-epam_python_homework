"""
We have a file that works as key-value storage, each like is represented as
 key and value separated by = symbol, example:
name=kek last_name=top song_name=shadilay power=9001
Values can be strings or integer numbers. If a value can be treated both as
 a number and a string, it is treated as number.
Write a wrapper class for this key value storage that works like this:
storage = KeyValueStorage('path_to_file.txt') that has its keys and values accessible as collection items and as
attributes. Example: storage['name'] # will be string 'kek'
storage.song_name # will be 'shadilay' storage.power # will be integer 9001
In case of attribute clash existing built-in attributes take precedence.
 In case when value cannot be assigned to an attribute (for example when there's a line 1=something) ValueError
 should be raised. File size is expected to be small, you are permitted to read it entirely into memory.
