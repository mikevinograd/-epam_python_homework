"""
Write a function that gets file path as an argument.
Read the first line of the file.
If first line is a number return true if number in an interval [1, 3)*
and false otherwise.
In case of any error, a ValueError should be thrown.
Write a test for that function using pytest library.
Definition of done:
 - function is created
 - function is properly formatted
 - function has positive and negative tests
 - all temporary files are removed after test run
You will learn:
 - how to test Exceptional cases
 - how to clean up after tests
 - how to check if file exists**
 - how to handle*** and raise**** exceptions in test. Use sample from the documentation.
